# The Game
This is an RPG based on Final Fantasy. The player builds a party by choosing between a male or female character to each of the vocations (warrior, ranger, healer, and mage). There are five regions, the center that is the town where the player is safe. In that region, there are some NPCs who tell something to the player. The north region contains the weakest creatures to hunt. The south region contains a little stronger creatures to hunt than the norths. The east region contains stronger creatures to hunt than the souths. Finally, the west region contains the strongest creatures to hunt and the final boss.

The goal is to hunt creatures from the weakest to the strongest to level up each of the party characters and go to defeat to the final boss to end the game. If all of the characters of the party die, then the game is over and the player will have to start again from the beginning.
